The following is a list of terminology relevant to InterSystems IRIS® data platform.
Terms Beginning with Symbols and A $X/$Y action table System. Internal table that specifies whether a character, on input to or output from a device, modifies $X, $Y, or both. The special variables $X and $Y keep track of the horizontal and vertical coordinates on the device. $ZF function ObjectScript. An InterSystems implementation-specific function that lets you invoke external programs or routines from within InterSystems IRIS. On UNIX®, you can use $ZF functions to issue UNIX® shell commands, call UNIX® System Services, or call routines written in high-level languages, such as C. abstract class Objects. An abstract class cannot be instantiated. It acts as a template for multiple non-abstract subclasses with common characteristics. abstract persistent class Objects. An abstract persistent class cannot be instantiated but is projected to InterSystems SQL as a table containing all of the data stored in its subclasses. access mode System. A category of the available connection tools, where each access mode has particular characteristics and is for particular situations. There are three different access modes: local (where the user interacts directly with InterSystems IRIS on the server machine); client-server (where the user connects to InterSystems IRIS from a separate executable, usually on a separate machine); and web (where the user interacts with InterSystems IRIS through a web application that uses the Web Gateway). activate System. To retrieve a database-encryption key from memory and store its value internally in a running InterSystems IRIS instance so that InterSystems IRIS can mount and manipulate an encrypted database. added role System. Any role that becomes associated with a user after that user authenticates to InterSystems IRIS. ad hoc query General. A SELECT statement used in embedded SQL or via ODBC or JDBC. Within object applications, ad hoc queries differ from normal queries in that they are not part of a class definition and they cannot be processed using the query interface. application mode System. The mode in which InterSystems IRIS initiates a terminal session in a pre-specified namespace and running a pre-specified program. In application mode, the user cannot initiate programs from the InterSystems IRIS prompt, and the terminal session ends when the user shuts down the program. Application mode is designed to allow users to perform a limited set of operations and not to gain access to other, more powerful aspects of the Terminal that are available in programmer mode. array Objects. A collection that uses key-value pairs to access data. Arrays are projected to SQL as child tables. ASCII character set System. For InterSystems products, ASCII refers to extended, 8-bit character sets, rather than the more limited, 7-bit character set. By default, an InterSystems IRIS instance uses the character set from the machine’s locale, as specified in Supported Languages for this release; if there is no support for a machine’s default language, InterSystems IRIS uses the ISO-8859-1 character set, commonly known as Latin-1. asset System. Data or functionality that is protected by InterSystems security. Assets are represented within InterSystems IRIS as resources; each resource represents one or more assets. atomic lock Objects. An atomic lock performs no locking for data stored in a single node of the database. It holds a shared lock while data stored in more than one node is being loaded and holds an exclusive lock while the same data is saved. attribute Objects. A data element representing a specific characteristic associated with a class. Each object of that class contains a literal value for the attribute. Together, the attributes of a class represent its state. Also known as a property. Strictly speaking, an attribute is any property that is not a relationship. audit database System. A database containing a list of some of the events that have occurred while InterSystems IRIS is running. When auditing is enabled, InterSystems IRIS logs various events, depending on the choices of the InterSystems IRIS administrator. Applications can also create and log their own events. The audit database is also known as the audit log. authentication System. The process by which users demonstrate that they are who they say they are. In the most commonly recognized case, this occurs by providing a password. However, other authentication schemes are commercially available. authentication mechanism System. A means by which a user is authenticated to InterSystems IRIS. Authentication can occur using Kerberos, the use of existing operating system credentials, a native InterSystems IRIS password prompt, LDAP, or delegated (that is, user-defined) code. authorization System. The process of determining what an authenticated user can do on an InterSystems IRIS system. Authorization includes several aspects: assigning roles to users (performed by a role-assignment mechanism); managing those roles and what they can do; and managing resources within InterSystems IRIS.
Terms Beginning with B binary stream Objects. A binary stream provides an interface to manipulate and store large chunks of binary data such as images. Data stored in a binary stream is not translated during Unicode conversions. The InterSystems IRIS stream interface can be used to manipulate binary streams in ObjectScript, SQL, and Java. bind InterSystems SQL. To associate a variable in an application program with a host variable using embedded SQL. BLOB InterSystems SQL. A BLOB, or Binary Large Object, is the relational term for a large chunk of data. InterSystems IRIS uses its stream interface to manipulate BLOBs. breakpoint ObjectScript. Location in an InterSystems IRIS routine that you specify with the ZBREAK command. When execution reaches that line, InterSystems IRIS suspends execution of the routine and, optionally, executes debugging actions you define. buffer General. Defined location of computer memory that holds specific information. Buffers make it easy for multiple processes to access the same data. For instance, InterSystems IRIS caches globals in global buffers, and routines in routine buffers.
Terms Beginning with C CLASSPATH Java. A system variable used by Java compilers to search for classes and packages referenced in the classes they compile. calculated property Objects. A property that has no in-memory storage allocated for it when the object containing it is instantiated. Instead, its value is determined each time it is requested. call method Objects. A method that directly invokes an InterSystems IRIS routine. callin interface System. InterSystems IRIS facility that lets you execute and evaluate ObjectScript commands and expressions from within C programs. You can also use the callin interface from $ZF routines. callback method Objects. Callback methods are called by system methods to allow additional user written processing during specific events. To distinguish these types of methods, they are given names of the form %OnEvent, where Event describes the event that triggers the callback. canonical form General. The canonical form of a name is its complete, standard, and unambiguous form. InterSystems IRIS has canonical forms for various entities, including numbers, global references, command options, files and paths, and devices.For information on the canonical form of numbers, see $NUMBER.For information on the canonical form of globals and the related naked global references, see Naked Global References or the $NAME or $ZREFERENCE reference pages.Information on the canonical form of command options appears on the reference page for the command itself.The canonical form of files, paths, and devices depends on the operating system. For example, on Windows, a reference to the file ..\iris.wij is not in canonical form, while C:\InterSystems\MyIRIS\IRIS.WIJ is (if there is an instance of InterSystems IRIS called MyIRIS and installed in the standard location).For UNIX®, an example of the canonical form of a device name is /dev/tty. cascading dot syntax Objects. Cascading dot syntax is used to follow the chain of other objects referenced by an object and directly manipulate the properties and methods of these referenced objects. For example: character set System. A set of values that defines the internal representation of InterSystems IRIS data for an instance. character stream Objects. A character stream provides an interface to manipulate and store large chunks of text-based data. Data stored in a character stream is translated during Unicode conversions. The InterSystems IRIS stream interface can be used to manipulate character streams in ObjectScript, SQL, and Java. child table InterSystems SQL. A table that is dependent on another table (its parent). Rows in a child table must have a pointer to a row in the parent table. circular reference Objects. A set of two properties in different classes where each property is a reference to the other class. InterSystems IRIS fully supports circular references as long as both properties are not required properties. If both properties in a circular reference are required, you will not be able to save objects of either class. class compiler Objects. The class compiler compiles InterSystems IRIS classes. You can use the class compiler from your IDE or by using one of the compile calls in the InterSystems IRIS object utility library. Class Definition Language Objects. The InterSystems IRIS Class Definition Language, CDL, is a keyword-based language used to define classes in InterSystems IRIS. class descriptor Objects. A special type of routine that contains the runtime information (list of methods and properties) needed to use objects. class dictionary Objects. The class dictionary holds the current class definition of all compiled classes. The class dictionary is also used by InterSystems SQL to determine valid table definitions. class hierarchy Objects. The class hierarchy shows the chain of classes from each root class through each of its subclasses and their subclasses. class member Objects. An element that belongs to a class. Class members can be properties, methods, parameters, queries, indexes, triggers, or XData blocks. class method Objects. A method that can be invoked whether or not an instance of its class is in memory. class Objects. A class encapsulates the state and behavior of a single entity. A class consists of some type information and a set of class members including properties, methods, parameters, queries, and indexes.InterSystems IRIS supports two main kinds of classes: data type classes and object classes. It supports many kinds of object classes including abstract classes, abstract persistent classes, persistent classes, embeddable classes, non-registered classes, registered classes, and system classes. client data type Objects. The client data type is used to specify information needed to project data to clients via an InterSystems IRIS Object Server. Every data type class must have a client data type. Attributes based on a data type class project that class’s client data type as the attribute’s data type to SQL and clients such as Java. client lock System. See outgoing lock. client System. The machine on which your application runs. It is connected to the server machine, on which your database resides. Also, a node on a network that can request information from other nodes. client application System. An executable separate from the InterSystems IRIS executable, but which relies on InterSystems IRIS, for example, as a data source. Such an application can be registered with InterSystems IRIS and thereby regulated as part of the InterSystems security model. The user of a client application must be authenticated to InterSystems IRIS using one of the supported authentication mechanisms. code method Objects. A method that executes ObjectScript. collation rule System. An algorithm that determines the order in which InterSystems IRIS retrieves global nodes. InterSystems IRIS built-in collation rules include UNICODE, ANSI and string. In ANSI collation, canonical numeric subscripts come first in numeric order, followed by all others in string order; string order is the order of characters in the character set. String rule orders all subscripts as strings in the character set, just as the ObjectScript "]" operator does. collation sequence System. Specifies the order in which InterSystems IRIS retrieves global nodes, when it must retrieve nodes in order. A character set and a collation rule together make up a collation sequence. Each global is associated with a particular collation sequence. collation InterSystems SQL. Collation specifies how InterSystems SQL transforms data before it is sorted. Each data type has a default collation type. Properties based on a data type use its collation type unless a property collation type is explicitly defined. Indexes use the collation type of the properties they index unless an index collation type is explicitly specified.InterSystems SQL supports the following preferred collation types: EXACT, SQLUPPER, and SQLSTRING. SQLUPPER is the default for data types based on %StringOpens in a new tab. EXACT is the default for all other data types. collection Objects. A collection is a property containing multiple elements (either literal values or objects). InterSystems IRIS supports two types of collections: lists and arrays. column InterSystems SQL. A column contains a specific element of data for each instance stored within a table. Properties are projected to SQL as columns. communications protocol General. A set of conventions that define how data is transferred between computers on a network. More specifically, it is the software that determines how a message packet is formatted. Communication protocols are used to talk to a network interface device. More than one communication protocol can share the same physical interface device. compilation flag Objects. A compilation flag tells the class compiler how to compile classes. Compilation flags control which classes are compiled, whether source code is deleted from the system, and how InterSystems IRIS handles compiling classes with objects in memory. compilation Objects. The process which transforms InterSystems IRIS classes and routines into executable code. compiler directive Objects. A compiler directive provides information on the files needed to successfully compile a specific class or routine. Examples of compiler directives include specifying include files and specifying that a class must be compiled after another class has already been compiled. computed field Objects. A field whose value is derived from a calculation defined in ObjectScript compiled code. ObjectScript compiled code can reference other fields in the associated base table as well as ObjectScript functions and special variables. computer name System. The name assigned to one processor, its peripheral equipment, and all of its associated datasets. This name must be unique across the network. See also System Name. concurrency mode Objects. The concurrency mode determines what type of locking is performed when you open and save objects. InterSystems IRIS supports five concurrency modes (0-4) which allow you to specify no locking, atomic locking, shared locking, shared retained locking, and exclusive locking. concurrency Objects. Concurrency provides a mechanism for controlling data integrity through locking. InterSystems IRIS supports five concurrency modes ranging from performing no locking to holding an exclusive lock from the time an object is loaded into memory until it is saved. By default, InterSystems IRIS uses atomic locking for all objects. concurrent backup System. A backup performed without stopping other database activity. InterSystems IRIS uses a multipass method that minimizes the impact of backup on users while maintaining the integrity of the backup.Note: Transaction processing that occurs during backup may not be completely journaled if you clear, delete, or replace the current journal file as part of backup. configuration System. An InterSystems IRIS configuration describes InterSystems IRIS resources at startup. You define a configuration in the Management Portal. You can create more than one configuration, although only one can be current at a time. InterSystems IRIS uses the current configuration at startup. connection System. A link between a client application or tool and InterSystems IRIS. Each connection has an associated process on the InterSystems IRIS server. connection security level System. Specifies which Kerberos functionality protects a client-server connection. The available levels are: initial authentication only (often simply called Kerberos); initial authentication and packet integrity (often called Kerberos with packet integrity); and initial authentication, packet integrity, and encryption of all messages (often called Kerberos with encryption). connection tool System. The means by which users establish their connection with InterSystems IRIS (such as the Terminal or Java). conversion code Objects. Compiled code used by InterSystems IRIS to convert data values from internal storage formats to external display formats, and from external input formats to internal storage formats. CPF System. Short for Configuration Parameter File, a CPF is a file with a .cpf extension that defines a configuration. See Configuration. credentials cache System. A file containing authentication information for a previously identified user. The credentials cache is used to speed up the authentication process by avoiding duplicated effort. Used most frequently in reference to Kerberos authentication. current device System. The device through which I/O commands are processed. When you log on, your current device is your principal device. This is usually the terminal or personal computer at which you logged on. current directory General. The directory in which you are currently working. cursor-based SQL InterSystems SQL. A type of embedded SQL query that opens a cursor to process the query. When your application needs to access multiple rows of data, you must use a cursor. A cursor acts like a pointer—it focuses on accessing and processing one row at a time, then moves from that row to the next in the sequence. cursor InterSystems SQL. A forward-moving iterator within multiple rows of data. custom storage Objects. Custom storage allows you to determine the storage structure of objects by writing your own implementation of the storage interface methods. Generally, classes that use custom storage are not projected to SQL.
Terms Beginning with D database General. A IRIS.DAT file. It can contain code and data. Via global, package, and routine mappings, any given database can be used by multiple namespaces. database cache System. System memory (RAM) used to cache data retrieved from databases, so that repeated instances of the same query can retrieve results from memory rather than storage, providing a very significant performance benefit. For best performance, the database cache should be at least as big as the application workload’s working set. database encryption System. The process by which an InterSystems IRIS database is stored on disk in an encrypted state. When InterSystems IRIS reads the data from the disk it is automatically decrypted at runtime so that its data can be available to its legitimate users. When the data is written to disk, it is encrypted. The data on disk is also referred to as being at rest. database-encryption key System. An AES key used to encrypt an InterSystems IRIS database. database integrity General. The condition of a database being uncorrupted, either in its contents or its structure. The data in a database can sometimes become unreadable by degradation of its physical integrity. Internal pointers can become corrupted due to degradation of internal integrity. Data Definition Language InterSystems SQL. Data Definition Language or DDL is a command-based language used to create, define the structure of, and delete tables. data location System. The dataset in which a global resides. The source of global sets and kills for a replicated global is the directory (or directory and system) mapped to the global’s data location. dataset General. A logical entity that represents a directory name or directory and system name in InterSystems IRIS. Data Source Name (DSN) ODBC. A data source name identifies a specific database on a specific server system. data type Objects. The data type of an attribute determines its behavior, its validation requirements, and how it is projected to SQL and clients such as Java. data type class Objects. A data type is a class with its DATATYPE class keyword set that supports the data type interface. This interface includes a number of operations designed for validation and SQL interoperability. DDL import utility Objects. A utility included in the InterSystems IRIS Relational Utility Library to import DDL files into InterSystems IRIS. The utility automatically adds the corresponding definition to the Class Dictionary. deep save Objects. A deep save saves an object and all objects that it references, as described in class reference content for the %Persistent.%SaveOpens in a new tab method. default dataset System. The directory in which a namespace executes commands and receives any globals not independently mapped. default start routine System. A default start routine is run automatically when a user logs in. dependent relationship Objects. A parent-child relationship that defines a child table for each row of the parent table. device accounts System. Device accounts allow TELNET users to log in to specific routines and namespaces on your system remotely and locally. You may set up user accounts and/or device accounts using the Management Portal to facilitate better control over which users have access to specific routines, databases and namespaces. directory General. A name for a location on a disk where files can be stored. The InterSystems IRIS database file, IRIS.DAT, resides in a directory. Only one InterSystems IRIS database file is permitted per directory. dismount, dismounted System. To dismount a database is to disconnect it from an instance of InterSystems IRIS. When a database is dismounted, it must be explicitly mounted again for an instance to use it. display format Objects. The display format of a property is the format used to display and input data. distributed database System. A database that is stored on multiple computers in a network. When you use InterSystems IRIS in a distributed database environment, ObjectScript routines that reside on one computer can access globals on other computers in the network, within the file protection limits established on those systems. DMNNET System. An InterSystems IRIS process that handles incoming global requests from a network. It is the name that appears on the System Status (%SS) display or the Processes panel in System Operations Utilities to represent the network daemon. dot syntax Objects. Dot syntax allows you to get and set property values and to execute methods. It also allows you to access the properties and methods of referenced and embedded objects from the object referencing them.
Terms Beginning with E embeddable class Objects. Objects derived from an embeddable (serial) class can exist independently in memory, but, when stored to the database, exist only as data stored within a persistent object. See %SerialObjectOpens in a new tab. embedded HTML ObjectScript. HTML that is directly embedded within ObjectScript methods or macro routines. Embedded HTML must be encased within &html<> statements. embedded object Objects. An instance of an embeddable class. Embedded objects are separate objects in memory but can only be stored as data embedded within a persistent object. embedded SQL InterSystems SQL. Embedded SQL is SQL directly embedded within ObjectScript methods or macro routines. Embedded SQL must be encased within &sql() statements. empty string System. A string that logically has no characters in it, often represented in text as "". Some material may also refer to this as the null string.Different languages differently represent the empty string, which determines if and how it occupies real space in computer memory. For example, in ObjectScript, "" does not occupy space in memory, while, in SQL, it does. Note also that a string with no characters in it is still a string and that, depending on the context, may be treated differently from the NULL (unassigned) value.For example, in the following ObjectScript code: the first Write statement succeeds (though this is not evident visually) and the second results in an <UNDEFINED> error. encapsulation Objects. Encapsulation hides the internal details of a class by presenting a public interface that outlines all of the allowed interactions of the class without presenting any of the details used to perform those operations. endian System. Whether a system is big-endian or little-endian refers to the order in which it stores the bytes of a multibyte element. InterSystems IRIS supports both big-endian and little-endian systems. It also includes a utility, cvendian, for converting databases from one form to the other. For details about cvendian, see the section on Using cvendian to Convert Between Big-endian and Little-endian Systems. Enterprise Cache Protocol (ECP) System. The internal networking system for InterSystems IRIS. ECP networking allows you to use InterSystems IRIS in a distributed database environment that contains a configurable number of nodes and a variety of hardware and software configurations. enumerated attribute Objects. Enumerated attributes allow multiple choice values for a property value. The value of these attributes must be one of the predetermined choices. exclusive lock General. An exclusive lock prevents another process from viewing or editing the specified data.If you use an exclusive lock when you open an object, it acquires an exclusive lock when the object is opened and releases it when the object is closed. explicit reference System. Also called extended reference. A global reference that is made with a full definition of the system and namespace where the global resides. expression method Objects. An object method that may be placed in-line in the code generated by the class compiler. extended global reference System. Also called explicit reference. A global reference that identifies the location of the global. The location can be specified as either a defined namespace or an implied namespace. Used when an InterSystems IRIS application needs to override the current namespace mapping for the global, which resolves to a different directory, or directory and system, than the one desired. For example, if the application is running in namespace ADMIN but needs to refer to a global ^PARTS in the INVEN namespace, you can use the extended reference: ^["INVEN"]PARTS. If, on the other hand, a specific physical location is desired instead of the mapping currently in force for a particular namespace, you can use an implied namespace. To refer to global ^PARTS in the directory "inven" on the computer with the directory set name "production" on a UNIX® computer, you might make the extended reference: ^["^production^/usr/inven"]PARTS. extent index Objects. An extent index maintains an index of all of the objects in an extent. extent query Objects. A query that returns the ID of every object in the extent. extent Objects. An extent spans the entire hierarchy tree of a specific class, called the root class. InterSystems SQL tables contain the entire extent of their corresponding class.
Terms Beginning with F factory class Objects. Objects instantiated from the Factory class in Java manage connections to InterSystems IRIS. They also create and open instances of other InterSystems IRIS classes and provide other administrative functionality. field Objects. Another name for an SQL column. file stream Objects. A file stream provides an interface to manipulate and store large chunks of text-based or binary data in an external file. The InterSystems IRIS stream interface can be used to manipulate file streams in ObjectScript, SQL, and Java. final class Objects. A class that cannot be extended or subclassed. final method Objects. A method that cannot be overridden. final property Objects. A property that cannot be overridden. foreign key InterSystems SQL. A foreign key constrains a column in a table to point to another column in a table. The value supplied for the first column must exist in the second column. foundation Health care. In InterSystems IRIS for Health™ and HealthShare®, a namespace that is enabled for health care interoperability.
Terms Beginning with G global System. A multidimensional storage structure. Globals are implemented using balanced-tree technology within an InterSystems IRIS database. A global is a kind of variable. globals database System. The underlying logical and physical data storage structure of InterSystems IRIS, in which all data is stored in a system of multiply-subscripted arrays called “globals.” global directory System. A directory that contains a globals database. It includes the database files and a list of all globals in the directory, with associated information. globally unique identifier (GUID) System. A GUID is an identifier for an entity, such as an instance of a class, that is trusted to be unique for all instances of InterSystems IRIS, even across multiple systems. For example, if two independent instances of InterSystems IRIS use a common class definition that includes a GUID for each instance, then bringing the data together from these two instances will not result in any duplicate GUID values. InterSystems IRIS uses GUIDs as part of object synchronization. For general information about using GUIDs, see the class documentation for %ExtentMgr.GUIDOpens in a new tab and %Library.GlobalIdentifierOpens in a new tab. GSA file System. A GSA file is a globals save file. The GSA file extension is not a requirement, but allows InterSystems IRIS and programmers to easily identify saved globals. Other than the file extension, there is no significance to a GSA file.
Terms Beginning with H host name General. The name of the server system. host variable InterSystems SQL. A variable that is linked, within an embedded SQL statement, to an application program variable.
Terms Beginning with I identified by Objects. A class is identified by another class when it is logically dependent on that class for its existence. identifying relationship Objects. An identifying relationship defines a relationship between two classes where one class is dependent upon the other for its existence. identity Objects. The identity, or ID, of an object uniquely identifies it within its extent. idkey Objects. An index that is used to designate the contents of the ID of an object. Any properties used in an idkey must remain static throughout the life of the object. implicit global reference System. See Mapped Global Reference. implied namespace System. A namespace that InterSystems IRIS creates internally when you use a directory or directory and system name in an extended global reference. include file ObjectScript. Files containing definitions that can be used in the preprocessor phase of ObjectScript source code compilation to expand macro source routines and determine whether optional lines of code should be included. They also can be used to include a common block of code in several routines, saving the overhead of calls to a common subroutine. incoming lock System. A lock issued by a process on a remote client computer on an item on the local computer. It is also called a server lock, since the item being locked is located on the local computer, which is acting as a server. When you view locks, this lock appears in the Lock Table display with the system name of the remote computer that issued the LOCK request in the Owner column. The local server computer does not know which process on the remote client computer issued the LOCK nor does it track the number of locks on the item. index Objects. An index optimizes data retrieval by storing a sorted subset of the data for each object belonging to its class. index collation Objects. Index collation specifies the data translation to use when storing data in an index. inheritance Objects. Inheritance passes the characteristics and members of a class to all of its subclasses. It allows you to group common aspects of multiple classes together in one superclass. in-memory value Objects. The value of a property while it is in memory. For some types of properties, this can differ from its stored, or on-disk, value. install-dir System. When generically referring to the InterSystems IRIS installation directory, the documentation uses the term install-dir. In its examples, the documentation uses C:\MyIRIS\. The section Default Installation Directory describes where InterSystems IRIS is installed on all supported operating systems. instance Objects. An implementation of a class representing a specific entity. The terms instance and object can be used interchangeably. Instance Authentication System. The native InterSystems authentication system: a user is prompted for a password, a hash of the supplied password is passed to the InterSystems IRIS server, and that hash is compared to the hash of the existing password stored in the server. If the two values are identical, InterSystems IRIS then grants authorization to those resources for which the user has privileges.This mechanism is listed in the Management Portal as Password authentication. instance method Objects. A method that is invoked from a specific instance of a class and performs some action related to that instance. instantiate Objects. To place an object instance into memory where a program can act upon it. intermediate source code ObjectScript. The standard 3GL (third generation language) ObjectScript source code available in InterSystems IRIS. Intermediate code is produced from macro source by the InterSystems IRIS compiler. At this level, all preprocessor syntax, including embedded SQL, has been resolved, and the routine contains only pure source code. It is possible to write ObjectScript routines at this level, but without the benefit of embedded SQL or other preprocessor syntax, such as macros. InterSystems IRIS launcher System. The icon that appears on the taskbar when you start InterSystems IRIS on a Windows system. From this icon, you can configure and manage your InterSystems IRIS systems as well as create and manage classes and routines. InterSystems IRIS database System. A collection of related data stored in globals and routines within a single directory, namespace, or UIC. InterSystems IRIS Object Server for Java Objects. The InterSystems IRIS Java Binding gives client applications written in Java access to server-based InterSystems IRIS objects. InterSystems IRIS object utility library Objects. The InterSystems IRIS Object Utility Library provides an interface to configure the object components of InterSystems IRIS, manipulate and compile classes, and interactively use objects. The primary interface to these utilities is via the %SYSTEM.OBJOpens in a new tab class. InterSystems IRIS relational utility library InterSystems SQL. The InterSystems IRIS relational utility library provides an interface to configure InterSystems SQL, manage the InterSystems SQL Server, and import DDL from other relational databases. The primary interface to these utilities is via the %SYSTEM.SQLOpens in a new tab class. InterSystems IRIS server System. Facility that allows you to use a distributed InterSystems IRIS database in a networked system. InterSystems IRIS storage Objects. The default storage type for persistent objects. If you use InterSystems IRIS Storage, you do not need to specify any details about how to store your data and your classes are automatically projected to SQL. InterSystems SQL InterSystems SQL. An advanced relational interface to InterSystems IRIS. InterSystems SQL is fully integrated with the object functionality of InterSystems IRIS, sharing its Class Dictionary for table definition and using Advanced Data Types defined as classes. InterSystems SQL server InterSystems SQL. The InterSystems SQL server handles SQL requests from client applications to apply queries and updates to an InterSystems IRIS database, error logging, and other SQL-related tasks. This is the server process that the ODBC and JDBC drivers connect to. InterSystems SQL storage Objects. InterSystems SQL storage provides a mechanism for using SQL to insert, update, and retrieve data via the object persistent interface. Classes use InterSystems SQL Storage if their storage definition specifies the %Storage.SQL storage class and includes an SQL mapping section. I/O translation System. National Language Support facility consisting of a set of tables that transform between the character set of the computer and a particular device’s character set. See also Language Configuration. IP address InterSystems IRIS System. The numeric identifier for a computer according to the Internet Protocol (IP). InterSystems IRIS supports both IPv6 and IPv4 formats. For more information on InterSystems IRIS support for IPv6, see Use of IPv6 Addressing. IRIS.DAT System. The primary volume in an InterSystems IRIS database. It contains InterSystems IRIS globals and routines. ITG file System. An ASCII file that contains a database integrity report with an extension of .ITG for easy identification. An ITG file is created by a database integrity check.
Terms Beginning with J Java General. An object-oriented language originally created by Sun Microsystems. Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) General. Java Database Connectivity, or JDBC, provides a standard Java interface for relational data access. JOBbed process System. A background process created by issuing an ObjectScript JOB command at the InterSystems IRIS prompt or from within an application. On the relational server system, server masters, and the server processes they create, are examples of JOBbed processes. join InterSystems SQL. A request for information from an InterSystems IRIS relational database base table (via a query, form, or report) in which data must be retrieved from more than one table, necessitating a link between tables. journaling System. A feature that, at the system manager’s option, causes InterSystems IRIS to keep a log of changes to all or selected globals in a journal file. If there is a system failure, these changes can be rolled forward. That is, an entire transaction can be reapplied to a database during a restore. See also Write Image Journaling.
Terms Beginning with K KDC System. Key Distribution Center. As part of a Kerberos installation, this is the central Kerberos server that ensures the proper authentication of all parties. Specifically, the KDC is part of the trusted third-party Kerberos server that generates the keys that form the basis of ticket-granting tickets and service tickets. On Windows, the Key Distribution Center is part of the Windows Domain Controller (DC) and is sometimes called by that name. The commonality of the two initials is coincidental. Kerberos System. A trusted third-party authentication system developed by Project Athena at MIT. It allows for the authentication of users or applications (collectively known as principals) by establishing a database of authentication information. This database is secured (and therefore trusted) and separate from any two parties performing authentication (which is why it is a third-party system). Kerberos is designed to be used on networks that are not necessarily secure, such as the Internet. It has been in use in large commercial and educational institutions since the late 1980’s. key (unique index) Objects. A key is another name for a unique index. key (encryption) System. A large number used with an encryption algorithm to encrypt or decrypt data. key-encryption key System. With InterSystems IRIS database encryption, the second key involved in the process. The first key is used to encrypt the database and the key-encryption key — the second key — is used to encrypt (and therefore protect) the first key. When a database-encryption key is activated, it is decrypted with a key-encryption key and loaded into memory for use. keyword (class definition) Objects. A keyword defines a specific characteristic within a class definition. Also known as a class keyword. keyword (system element) System. A keyword may also refer to part of the InterSystems IRIS system, such as a function name or operator.

A logical reference to a global that resides in a different directory, without using the extended reference syntax otherwise required to refer to a remote global. You can refer to the global as if it resides in the database’s data location. That home directory can be on the same computer or any other computer on the network known to your InterSystems IRIS server. The system manager defines the actual location of a mapped global using the namespace/network configuration editor. matching role System.

A class inherits characteristics and class members from each of its superclasses.
Terms Beginning with N namespace System. A logical entity that provides access to data and code physically stored in databases. References to database objects are made logically through namespaces rather than to physical database locations. Namespace mappings specify the database locations of globals so users and code need only make a simple reference to a global in a namespace, without having to be concerned with the physical location of the data it contains. For example, namespace mappings allow you to collect objects from multiple databases into a single namespace, which serves as a single frame of reference, as if they were all stored together. For information on namespace names, see Configuring Namespaces. National Language Support (NLS) System. An InterSystems IRIS facility that helps you overcome differences among national languages that affect the way you enter, display, process, store, and transfer data. It consists of a set of tables that specify the internal character set, a collation sequence, pattern match, $X/$Y actions, and I/O translation. The system manager defines and loads these tables with the NLS utility.

See object reference. outgoing lock System. A lock issued by a process on the local client computer on an item on a remote server computer. It is also called a client lock, since the local computer is the client. When you run the LOCKTAB utility from the Terminal or the Locks utility in System Operations Utilities, this lock appears in the Lock Table display with an asterisk preceding the pid of the process issuing the lock. If incremental locks are issued on an item that already exists in the Lock Table, these requests are not sent across the network. Rather, the local computer keeps track of the number of incremental locks on outgoing locks. override Objects. By default, every class inherits the class members of its superclasses. However, unless a member is marked final, you can chose to modify the member so it acts differently in the subclass. This is called overriding the member.

This allows access to the actual variable so that the variable’s actual value can be changed by the method, function, or routine to which it is passed. passing by value A way of passing the value of an argument. This provides a copy of the variable. As a result, the variable’s actual value cannot be changed by the method, function, or routine to which it is passed. pattern match table System. Internal table that tells InterSystems IRIS whether to treat characters as alphabetic, punctuation, numeric, or control characters. permission System. The ability to perform an activity on a resource. For database resources, the available permissions are Read and Write.

In application mode, the user cannot initiate programs from the InterSystems IRIS prompt, and the terminal session ends when the user shuts down the program. Application mode is designed to allow users to perform a limited set of operations and not to gain access to other, more powerful aspects of the Terminal that are available in programmer mode.
array Objects. A collection that uses key-value pairs to access data. Arrays are projected to SQL as child tables.
ASCII character set System. For InterSystems products, ASCII refers to extended, 8-bit character sets, rather than the more limited, 7-bit character set. By default, an InterSystems IRIS instance uses the character set from the machine’s locale, as specified in Supported Languages for this release; if there is no support for a machine’s default language, InterSystems IRIS uses the ISO-8859-1 character set, commonly known as Latin-1.
asset System. Data or functionality that is protected by InterSystems security. Assets are represented within InterSystems IRIS as resources; each resource represents one or more assets.
atomic lock Objects. An atomic lock performs no locking for data stored in a single node of the database. It holds a shared lock while data stored in more than one node is being loaded and holds an exclusive lock while the same data is saved.
attribute Objects. A data element representing a specific characteristic associated with a class. Each object of that class contains a literal value for the attribute. Together, the attributes of a class represent its state. Also known as a property. Strictly speaking, an attribute is any property that is not a relationship.
audit database System. A database containing a list of some of the events that have occurred while InterSystems IRIS is running. When auditing is enabled, InterSystems IRIS logs various events, depending on the choices of the InterSystems IRIS administrator. Applications can also create and log their own events. The audit database is also known as the audit log.
authentication System. The process by which users demonstrate that they are who they say they are. In the most commonly recognized case, this occurs by providing a password. However, other authentication schemes are commercially available.
authentication mechanism System. A means by which a user is authenticated to InterSystems IRIS. Authentication can occur using Kerberos, the use of existing operating system credentials, a native InterSystems IRIS password prompt, LDAP, or delegated (that is, user-defined) code.
authorization System. The process of determining what an authenticated user can do on an InterSystems IRIS system. Authorization includes several aspects: assigning roles to users (performed by a role-assignment mechanism); managing those roles and what they can do; and managing resources within InterSystems IRIS.

## Terms Beginning with B

binary stream Objects. A binary stream provides an interface to manipulate and store large chunks of binary data such as images. Data stored in a binary stream is not translated during Unicode conversions. The InterSystems IRIS stream interface can be used to manipulate binary streams in ObjectScript, SQL, and Java.
bind InterSystems SQL. To associate a variable in an application program with a host variable using embedded SQL.
BLOB InterSystems SQL. A BLOB, or Binary Large Object, is the relational term for a large chunk of data. InterSystems IRIS uses its stream interface to manipulate BLOBs.
breakpoint ObjectScript. Location in an InterSystems IRIS routine that you specify with the ZBREAK command. When execution reaches that line, InterSystems IRIS suspends execution of the routine and, optionally, executes debugging actions you define.
buffer General. Defined location of computer memory that holds specific information. Buffers make it easy for multiple processes to access the same data. For instance, InterSystems IRIS caches globals in global buffers, and routines in routine buffers.

## Terms Beginning with C

CLASSPATH Java. A system variable used by Java compilers to search for classes and packages referenced in the classes they compile.

callin interface System. InterSystems IRIS facility that lets you execute and evaluate ObjectScript commands and expressions from within C programs. You can also use the callin interface from $ZF routines.
callback method Objects. Callback methods are called by system methods to allow additional user written processing during specific events. To distinguish these types of methods, they are given names of the form %OnEvent, where Event describes the event that triggers the callback.
canonical form General. The canonical form of a name is its complete, standard, and unambiguous form. InterSystems IRIS has canonical forms for various entities, including numbers, global references, command options, files and paths, and devices.For information on the canonical form of numbers, see $NUMBER.For information on the canonical form of globals and the related naked global references, see Naked Global References or the $NAME or $ZREFERENCE reference pages.Information on the canonical form of command options appears on the reference page for the command itself.The canonical form of files, paths, and devices depends on the operating system. For example, on Windows, a reference to the file ..\iris.wij is not in canonical form, while C:\InterSystems\MyIRIS\IRIS.WIJ is (if there is an instance of InterSystems IRIS called MyIRIS and installed in the standard location).For UNIX®, an example of the canonical form of a device name is /dev/tty.
cascading dot syntax Objects. Cascading dot syntax is used to follow the chain of other objects referenced by an object and directly manipulate the properties and methods of these referenced objects. For example:
character set System. A set of values that defines the internal representation of InterSystems IRIS data for an instance.
character stream Objects. A character stream provides an interface to manipulate and store large chunks of text-based data. Data stored in a character stream is translated during Unicode conversions. The InterSystems IRIS stream interface can be used to manipulate character streams in ObjectScript, SQL, and Java.
child table InterSystems SQL. A table that is dependent on another table (its parent). Rows in a child table must have a pointer to a row in the parent table.
circular reference Objects. A set of two properties in different classes where each property is a reference to the other class. InterSystems IRIS fully supports circular references as long as both properties are not required properties.

class Objects. A class encapsulates the state and behavior of a single entity. A class consists of some type information and a set of class members including properties, methods, parameters, queries, and indexes.InterSystems IRIS supports two main kinds of classes: data type classes and object classes. It supports many kinds of object classes including abstract classes, abstract persistent classes, persistent classes, embeddable classes, non-registered classes, registered classes, and system classes.
client data type Objects. The client data type is used to specify information needed to project data to clients via an InterSystems IRIS Object Server. Every data type class must have a client data type. Attributes based on a data type class project that class’s client data type as the attribute’s data type to SQL and clients such as Java.
client lock System. See outgoing lock.
client System. The machine on which your application runs. It is connected to the server machine, on which your database resides. Also, a node on a network that can request information from other nodes.
client application System. An executable separate from the InterSystems IRIS executable, but which relies on InterSystems IRIS, for example, as a data source. Such an application can be registered with InterSystems IRIS and thereby regulated as part of the InterSystems security model. The user of a client application must be authenticated to InterSystems IRIS using one of the supported authentication mechanisms.
code method Objects. A method that executes ObjectScript.
collation rule System. An algorithm that determines the order in which InterSystems IRIS retrieves global nodes. InterSystems IRIS built-in collation rules include UNICODE, ANSI and string. In ANSI collation, canonical numeric subscripts come first in numeric order, followed by all others in string order; string order is the order of characters in the character set. String rule orders all subscripts as strings in the character set, just as the ObjectScript "]" operator does.
collation sequence System. Specifies the order in which InterSystems IRIS retrieves global nodes, when it must retrieve nodes in order. A character set and a collation rule together make up a collation sequence. Each global is associated with a particular collation sequence.
collation InterSystems SQL. Collation specifies how InterSystems SQL transforms data before it is sorted. Each data type has a default collation type. Properties based on a data type use its collation type unless a property collation type is explicitly defined. Indexes use the collation type of the properties they index unless an index collation type is explicitly specified.InterSystems SQL supports the following preferred collation types: EXACT, SQLUPPER, and SQLSTRING. SQLUPPER is the default for data types based on %StringOpens in a new tab. EXACT is the default for all other data types.
collection Objects. A collection is a property containing multiple elements (either literal values or objects). InterSystems IRIS supports two types of collections: lists and arrays.
column InterSystems SQL. A column contains a specific element of data for each instance stored within a table. Properties are projected to SQL as columns.
communications protocol General. A set of conventions that define how data is transferred between computers on a network. More specifically, it is the software that determines how a message packet is formatted. Communication protocols are used to talk to a network interface device. More than one communication protocol can share the same physical interface device.
compilation flag Objects. A compilation flag tells the class compiler how to compile classes. Compilation flags control which classes are compiled, whether source code is deleted from the system, and how InterSystems IRIS handles compiling classes with objects in memory.
compilation Objects. The process which transforms InterSystems IRIS classes and routines into executable code.
compiler directive Objects. A compiler directive provides information on the files needed to successfully compile a specific class or routine. Examples of compiler directives include specifying include files and specifying that a class must be compiled after another class has already been compiled.
computed field Objects. A field whose value is derived from a calculation defined in ObjectScript compiled code. ObjectScript compiled code can reference other fields in the associated base table as well as ObjectScript functions and special variables.
computer name System. The name assigned to one processor, its peripheral equipment, and all of its associated datasets. This name must be unique across the network. See also System Name.
concurrency mode Objects. The concurrency mode determines what type of locking is performed when you open and save objects. InterSystems IRIS supports five concurrency modes (0-4) which allow you to specify no locking, atomic locking, shared locking, shared retained locking, and exclusive locking.
concurrency Objects. Concurrency provides a mechanism for controlling data integrity through locking. InterSystems IRIS supports five concurrency modes ranging from performing no locking to holding an exclusive lock from the time an object is loaded into memory until it is saved. By default, InterSystems IRIS uses atomic locking for all objects.
concurrent backup System. A backup performed without stopping other database activity. InterSystems IRIS uses a multipass method that minimizes the impact of backup on users while maintaining the integrity of the backup.Note: Transaction processing that occurs during backup may not be completely journaled if you clear, delete, or replace the current journal file as part of backup.
configuration System. An InterSystems IRIS configuration describes InterSystems IRIS resources at startup. You define a configuration in the Management Portal. You can create more than one configuration, although only one can be current at a time. InterSystems IRIS uses the current configuration at startup.
connection System. A link between a client application or tool and InterSystems IRIS. Each connection has an associated process on the InterSystems IRIS server.
connection security level System. Specifies which Kerberos functionality protects a client-server connection. The available levels are: initial authentication only (often simply called Kerberos); initial authentication and packet integrity (often called Kerberos with packet integrity); and initial authentication, packet integrity, and encryption of all messages (often called Kerberos with encryption).
connection tool System. The means by which users establish their connection with InterSystems IRIS (such as the Terminal or Java).
conversion code Objects. Compiled code used by InterSystems IRIS to convert data values from internal storage formats to external display formats, and from external input formats to internal storage formats.
CPF System. Short for Configuration Parameter File, a CPF is a file with a .cpf extension that defines a configuration. See Configuration.
credentials cache System. A file containing authentication information for a previously identified user. The credentials cache is used to speed up the authentication process by avoiding duplicated effort. Used most frequently in reference to Kerberos authentication.
current device System. The device through which I/O commands are processed. When you log on, your current device is your principal device. This is usually the terminal or personal computer at which you logged on.
current directory General. The directory in which you are currently working.
cursor-based SQL InterSystems SQL. A type of embedded SQL query that opens a cursor to process the query. When your application needs to access multiple rows of data, you must use a cursor. A cursor acts like a pointer—it focuses on accessing and processing one row at a time, then moves from that row to the next in the sequence.
cursor InterSystems SQL. A forward-moving iterator within multiple rows of data.
custom storage Objects. Custom storage allows you to determine the storage structure of objects by writing your own implementation of the storage interface methods. Generally, classes that use custom storage are not projected to SQL.

## Terms Beginning with D

database General. A IRIS.DAT file. It can contain code and data. Via global, package, and routine mappings, any given database can be used by multiple namespaces.
database cache System. System memory (RAM) used to cache data retrieved from databases, so that repeated instances of the same query can retrieve results from memory rather than storage, providing a very significant performance benefit. For best performance, the database cache should be at least as big as the application workload’s working set.
database encryption System. The process by which an InterSystems IRIS database is stored on disk in an encrypted state. When InterSystems IRIS reads the data from the disk it is automatically decrypted at runtime so that its data can be available to its legitimate users. When the data is written to disk, it is encrypted. The data on disk is also referred to as being at rest.
database-encryption key System. An AES key used to encrypt an InterSystems IRIS database.
database integrity General. The condition of a database being uncorrupted, either in its contents or its structure. The data in a database can sometimes become unreadable by degradation of its physical integrity. Internal pointers can become corrupted due to degradation of internal integrity.
Data Definition Language InterSystems SQL. Data Definition Language or DDL is a command-based language used to create, define the structure of, and delete tables.

You may set up user accounts and/or device accounts using the Management Portal to facilitate better control over which users have access to specific routines, databases and namespaces.
directory General. A name for a location on a disk where files can be stored. The InterSystems IRIS database file, IRIS.DAT, resides in a directory. Only one InterSystems IRIS database file is permitted per directory.
dismount, dismounted System. To dismount a database is to disconnect it from an instance of InterSystems IRIS. When a database is dismounted, it must be explicitly mounted again for an instance to use it.
display format Objects. The display format of a property is the format used to display and input data.
distributed database System. A database that is stored on multiple computers in a network. When you use InterSystems IRIS in a distributed database environment, ObjectScript routines that reside on one computer can access globals on other computers in the network, within the file protection limits established on those systems.
DMNNET System. An InterSystems IRIS process that handles incoming global requests from a network. It is the name that appears on the System Status (%SS) display or the Processes panel in System Operations Utilities to represent the network daemon.

embedded HTML ObjectScript. HTML that is directly embedded within ObjectScript methods or macro routines. Embedded HTML must be encased within &html<> statements.
embedded object Objects. An instance of an embeddable class. Embedded objects are separate objects in memory but can only be stored as data embedded within a persistent object.
embedded SQL InterSystems SQL. Embedded SQL is SQL directly embedded within ObjectScript methods or macro routines. Embedded SQL must be encased within &sql() statements.
empty string System. A string that logically has no characters in it, often represented in text as "". Some material may also refer to this as the null string.Different languages differently represent the empty string, which determines if and how it occupies real space in computer memory. For example, in ObjectScript, "" does not occupy space in memory, while, in SQL, it does. Note also that a string with no characters in it is still a string and that, depending on the context, may be treated differently from the NULL (unassigned) value.For example, in the following ObjectScript code: the first Write statement succeeds (though this is not evident visually) and the second results in an <UNDEFINED> error.
encapsulation Objects. Encapsulation hides the internal details of a class by presenting a public interface that outlines all of the allowed interactions of the class without presenting any of the details used to perform those operations.
endian System. Whether a system is big-endian or little-endian refers to the order in which it stores the bytes of a multibyte element. InterSystems IRIS supports both big-endian and little-endian systems. It also includes a utility, cvendian, for converting databases from one form to the other. For details about cvendian, see the section on Using cvendian to Convert Between Big-endian and Little-endian Systems.
Enterprise Cache Protocol (ECP) System. The internal networking system for InterSystems IRIS. ECP networking allows you to use InterSystems IRIS in a distributed database environment that contains a configurable number of nodes and a variety of hardware and software configurations.
enumerated attribute Objects. Enumerated attributes allow multiple choice values for a property value. The value of these attributes must be one of the predetermined choices.
exclusive lock General. An exclusive lock prevents another process from viewing or editing the specified data.If you use an exclusive lock when you open an object, it acquires an exclusive lock when the object is opened and releases it when the object is closed.
explicit reference System. Also called extended reference. A global reference that is made with a full definition of the system and namespace where the global resides.
expression method Objects. An object method that may be placed in-line in the code generated by the class compiler.
extended global reference System. Also called explicit reference. A global reference that identifies the location of the global. The location can be specified as either a defined namespace or an implied namespace. Used when an InterSystems IRIS application needs to override the current namespace mapping for the global, which resolves to a different directory, or directory and system, than the one desired. For example, if the application is running in namespace ADMIN but needs to refer to a global ^PARTS in the INVEN namespace, you can use the extended reference: ^["INVEN"]PARTS. If, on the other hand, a specific physical location is desired instead of the mapping currently in force for a particular namespace, you can use an implied namespace. To refer to global ^PARTS in the directory "inven" on the computer with the directory set name "production" on a UNIX® computer, you might make the extended reference: ^["^production^/usr/inven"]PARTS.
extent index Objects. An extent index maintains an index of all of the objects in an extent.
extent query Objects. A query that returns the ID of every object in the extent.
extent Objects. An extent spans the entire hierarchy tree of a specific class, called the root class. InterSystems SQL tables contain the entire extent of their corresponding class.

globals database System. The underlying logical and physical data storage structure of InterSystems IRIS, in which all data is stored in a system of multiply-subscripted arrays called “globals.”
global directory System. A directory that contains a globals database. It includes the database files and a list of all globals in the directory, with associated information.
globally unique identifier (GUID) System. A GUID is an identifier for an entity, such as an instance of a class, that is trusted to be unique for all instances of InterSystems IRIS, even across multiple systems. For example, if two independent instances of InterSystems IRIS use a common class definition that includes a GUID for each instance, then bringing the data together from these two instances will not result in any duplicate GUID values. InterSystems IRIS uses GUIDs as part of object synchronization. For general information about using GUIDs, see the class documentation for %ExtentMgr.GUIDOpens in a new tab and %Library.GlobalIdentifierOpens in a new tab.
GSA file System. A GSA file is a globals save file. The GSA file extension is not a requirement, but allows InterSystems IRIS and programmers to easily identify saved globals. Other than the file extension, there is no significance to a GSA file.

include file ObjectScript. Files containing definitions that can be used in the preprocessor phase of ObjectScript source code compilation to expand macro source routines and determine whether optional lines of code should be included. They also can be used to include a common block of code in several routines, saving the overhead of calls to a common subroutine.
incoming lock System. A lock issued by a process on a remote client computer on an item on the local computer. It is also called a server lock, since the item being locked is located on the local computer, which is acting as a server. When you view locks, this lock appears in the Lock Table display with the system name of the remote computer that issued the LOCK request in the Owner column. The local server computer does not know which process on the remote client computer issued the LOCK nor does it track the number of locks on the item.
index Objects. An index optimizes data retrieval by storing a sorted subset of the data for each object belonging to its class.
index collation Objects. Index collation specifies the data translation to use when storing data in an index.
inheritance Objects. Inheritance passes the characteristics and members of a class to all of its subclasses. It allows you to group common aspects of multiple classes together in one superclass.

The section Default Installation Directory describes where InterSystems IRIS is installed on all supported operating systems.
instance Objects. An implementation of a class representing a specific entity. The terms instance and object can be used interchangeably.
Instance Authentication System. The native InterSystems authentication system: a user is prompted for a password, a hash of the supplied password is passed to the InterSystems IRIS server, and that hash is compared to the hash of the existing password stored in the server. If the two values are identical, InterSystems IRIS then grants authorization to those resources for which the user has privileges.This mechanism is listed in the Management Portal as Password authentication.
instance method Objects. A method that is invoked from a specific instance of a class and performs some action related to that instance.
instantiate Objects. To place an object instance into memory where a program can act upon it.
intermediate source code ObjectScript. The standard 3GL (third generation language) ObjectScript source code available in InterSystems IRIS. Intermediate code is produced from macro source by the InterSystems IRIS compiler. At this level, all preprocessor syntax, including embedded SQL, has been resolved, and the routine contains only pure source code. It is possible to write ObjectScript routines at this level, but without the benefit of embedded SQL or other preprocessor syntax, such as macros.

InterSystems SQL server InterSystems SQL. The InterSystems SQL server handles SQL requests from client applications to apply queries and updates to an InterSystems IRIS database, error logging, and other SQL-related tasks. This is the server process that the ODBC and JDBC drivers connect to.
InterSystems SQL storage Objects. InterSystems SQL storage provides a mechanism for using SQL to insert, update, and retrieve data via the object persistent interface. Classes use InterSystems SQL Storage if their storage definition specifies the %Storage.SQL storage class and includes an SQL mapping section.
I/O translation System. National Language Support facility consisting of a set of tables that transform between the character set of the computer and a particular device’s character set. See also Language Configuration.
IP address InterSystems IRIS System. The numeric identifier for a computer according to the Internet Protocol (IP). InterSystems IRIS supports both IPv6 and IPv4 formats. For more information on InterSystems IRIS support for IPv6, see Use of IPv6 Addressing.

join InterSystems SQL. A request for information from an InterSystems IRIS relational database base table (via a query, form, or report) in which data must be retrieved from more than one table, necessitating a link between tables.
journaling System. A feature that, at the system manager’s option, causes InterSystems IRIS to keep a log of changes to all or selected globals in a journal file. If there is a system failure, these changes can be rolled forward. That is, an entire transaction can be reapplied to a database during a restore. See also Write Image Journaling.

## Terms Beginning with K

KDC System. Key Distribution Center. As part of a Kerberos installation, this is the central Kerberos server that ensures the proper authentication of all parties. Specifically, the KDC is part of the trusted third-party Kerberos server that generates the keys that form the basis of ticket-granting tickets and service tickets. On Windows, the Key Distribution Center is part of the Windows Domain Controller (DC) and is sometimes called by that name. The commonality of the two initials is coincidental.
Kerberos System. A trusted third-party authentication system developed by Project Athena at MIT. It allows for the authentication of users or applications (collectively known as principals) by establishing a database of authentication information. This database is secured (and therefore trusted) and separate from any two parties performing authentication (which is why it is a third-party system). Kerberos is designed to be used on networks that are not necessarily secure, such as the Internet. It has been in use in large commercial and educational institutions since the late 1980’s.
key (unique index) Objects. A key is another name for a unique index.
key (encryption) System. A large number used with an encryption algorithm to encrypt or decrypt data.
key-encryption key System. With InterSystems IRIS database encryption, the second key involved in the process. The first key is used to encrypt the database and the key-encryption key — the second key — is used to encrypt (and therefore protect) the first key. When a database-encryption key is activated, it is decrypted with a key-encryption key and loaded into memory for use.
keyword (class definition) Objects. A keyword defines a specific characteristic within a class definition. Also known as a class keyword.
keyword (system element) System. A keyword may also refer to part of the InterSystems IRIS system, such as a function name or operator.

## Terms Beginning with N

namespace System. A logical entity that provides access to data and code physically stored in databases. References to database objects are made logically through namespaces rather than to physical database locations. Namespace mappings specify the database locations of globals so users and code need only make a simple reference to a global in a namespace, without having to be concerned with the physical location of the data it contains. For example, namespace mappings allow you to collect objects from multiple databases into a single namespace, which serves as a single frame of reference, as if they were all stored together. For information on namespace names, see Configuring Namespaces.
