# Interoperability Productions

InterSystems IRISÂ® data platform interoperability productions provide the integration engine to connect systems that use different communication protocols and different message formats. You can use built-in components and graphic wizards to connect systems without custom coding, use existing third party libraries, or create custom code to define new interfaces to systems.
In many cases, you can build your production using built-in components and data wizards that support formats such as XML, X12, EDIFACT, and delimited or fixed-column records. You can also use built-in components to support communication protocols such as HTTP, REST, SOAP, FTP, and files. You can interoperate with an LDAP server, via EnsLib.LDAP.Adapter.OutboundOpens in a new tab. If you need to deal with custom formats, you can develop production components in ObjectScript, Java, and .NET languages.
