# Embedded Language Development

As an application developer, InterSystems gives you multiple options. You can
Develop using several embedded languages that are part of the InterSystems IRISÂ® kernel. Code written in an embedded language executes as an InterSystems IRIS process. Develop using a number of external languages supported by InterSystems IRIS. Code written in an external language interacts with the InterSystems IRIS kernel using a driver in an InterSystems IRIS software development kit (SDK).
