# Deployment | InterSystems IRIS Data Platform 2025.2

# Deployment

Deploy InterSystems products in a public or private cloud or on premises, using one of these options.
Deploy on Kubernetes using the InterSystems Kubernetes operator The InterSystems Kubernetes Operator (IKO) extends the Kubernetes API with the IrisCluster custom resource, which can be deployed as an InterSystems IRIS sharded cluster, distributed cache cluster, or standalone instance (all optionally mirrored) on any Kubernetes platform. The IKO lets you take advantage of Kubernetes for automated deployment, scaling, and management of your containerized sharded cluster-based application.
Deploy in containers Deploying InterSystems products in containers is agile, highly repeatable, and well suited to public cloud platforms, as well as on-premises deployment. Containers cleanly separate code from data and support CI/CD and a DevOps approach, so you can push improvements to the field fast.
Deploy using an installation kit Use a traditional installation kit to install product instances on a wide range of platforms in any cloud or on premises environment.
Planning and automating configuration before deployment Before deploying InterSystems IRIS you should consider your system resources and plan your configuration accordingly. InterSystems IRIS provides several ways to automate deployment of multiple InterSystems IRIS instances with varying configurations, letting you deploy multiple topologies out of the box.
Deploy a free Community Edition instance You can deploy a free InterSystems IRIS® Community Edition container on a public cloud platform (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure) or on your own system. You can also set up a free web-based instanceOpens in a new tab that includes a built-in IDE.
